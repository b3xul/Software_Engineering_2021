# characterizations of sw process
Document-based or not, Number and duration of iterations, sequential/parallel activities, time framed or not, new development/maintenance

# validation of functional requirements
Prototyping, inspection, get feedback from end user representative, use gui prototypes, acceptance test cases

# check in and check out operations ??

# pair programming
2 programmers work together on the same code, one writes while the other checks if everything is correct and think about possible improvements, then after 1 hour they switch places.

# development: 6 months, 3 people. operation+maintenance: 12 years.
effort during development: 18person-months
effort during maintenance, assuming 1 person part-time: 6person-months*12years=72person-months

if maintenance>18person-months (18/12years=1.5person-months per year) then it will cost more!
